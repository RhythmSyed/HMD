ECE 477 Team 6

HMD is a wearable Health Monitoring Device that provides the user with real-time health information through a continuous stream to the cloud and to a companion app for client-side use. The system includes a wide variety of sensors that allow the device to monitor the activity of the user through step tracking and monitoring sleep quality. To ensure uninterrupted wear, the battery level of the device is recorded to insure the device is always powered. The system also includes an alert system for sleep reminders, low battery levels, and alerts to family members in case of health concerns. The system will also incorporate a display attached to the wearable informing the user his total steps and the battery percentage of the device.
